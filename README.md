# Caretaker Robot Based on Fire bird V

#### Introduction:

Welcome to the Git repository for my Bachelor's Degree Project on the development of a Caretaker Robot based on Fire-bird V! This repository serves as a central hub for all the code, documentation, and resources related to my research and development work in creating an autonomous robot capable of performing caretaker tasks. The purpose of this introduction is to provide an overview of the project and guide you through the contents of this repository.

#### Project Overview:

My Bachelor's Degree Project focuses on designing and implementing a Caretaker Robot based on the Fire-bird V robot. The objective is to create a versatile robot capable of assisting in various caretaker tasks, such as monitoring environments, delivering objects, and providing basic assistance. The project involves integrating sensors and intelligent algorithms to enable autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction.
